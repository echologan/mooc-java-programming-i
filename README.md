# Mooc Java Programming I

This repository contains my solutions to the programming exercises from the [MOOC Java Programming I course](https://www.mooc.fi/en/) provided by the University of Helsinki. The course is part of a series of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) on Java programming.

## Course Description

This course is an introduction to the basics of programming in Java. It covers fundamental concepts such as variables, loops, conditional statements, methods, and object-oriented programming principles. Through a series of exercises and programming assignments, learners develop their skills in writing Java programs and solving problems using programming techniques.

## Contents

- **Week-by-Week**: Each week of the course is organized into a separate folder, containing the programming exercises and assignments for that week.
- **Exercise Solutions**: Inside each week's folder, you'll find my solutions to the programming exercises. Each solution is provided in its own Java source file.
- **Additional Resources**: I've also included any additional resources, notes, or insights that I found helpful during the course.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
3. **Explore the Code**: Navigate through the folders to explore the exercises and solutions. You can open the Java files in your favorite text editor or IDE to review the code.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions from other learners who have completed or are currently taking the MOOC Java Programming I course. If you have any improvements, corrections, or additional solutions to the exercises, feel free to submit a pull request.
